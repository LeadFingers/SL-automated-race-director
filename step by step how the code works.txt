1- getxlname()
	get excel file name using manually updated .txt file
	return spreadsheetfile

2- getxlsx(spreadsheetfile)
	get data from last sheet in spreadsheet as dataframe
	return racedata

2- makeracers(racedata)
     make dictionary full of Racer class objects
	index = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...
	return racerdic

3- giveroundpoints(racersraw = racerdic)
    give racers points for the round by using a racer class method
	make racer workingdic w/ index = round time
	make list of round times
	sort the list of round times
	update racers points using class method + round time list order
	make rankeddic with racers in order w/ index = 0, 1, 2, ...
	return (rankeddic, workingdic)
	
4- firstsort(racersupdated[0] = rankeddic)
    sort the racers by their point totals + motocross rule
	make a big list of tiny lists
		tiny lists = [points, round time, name]
	sort the unsorted big list by tinylist[points]
		by some magic this does motocross rule for me
		probably has to do with the input dic being in
		the finishing order of the last round
	return firstsortlist

5- filalsort(sortedlist = firstsortlist, sorteddic = working dic)
   make a new racerlist that has the racer objects in the correct order
   for the next heat race
	    sortedlist = the big list of tiny lists
		tiny lists = [points, round time, name]
		in the correct ranking order for the next round
	    sorteddic = a dictionary of the racer objects
		indexes = the race times from last round
	make a new sortedpilotlist of length = sortedlist
	    the first sortedpilotlist value = sorteddic value ->
	    -> of index = to the first big list value's ->
	    -> tinylist[roundtime]
	return sortedpilotlist	

6- make dataframe(finallist, testdoc = racedata)
	turns finallist into a properly formatted dataframe
	uses racedata to make the new dataframe for the round
		after the last round
	return newdataframe

7- exporttoxl(newdataframe, testdoc = racedata, spreadsheetfile)
	not 100% on how this actually works but a I managed to 
	modify code from the internet so that it would work
